# Vite + React Template

A minimal, fast, and modern starter template using Vite and React — ready for building single-page applications.

## Features

- Vite for fast dev server and build
- React (with JSX/TSX support if you enable TypeScript)
- Opinionated structure and scripts for common workflows
- Configurable environment via `.env` files

## Quick start

1. Clone or copy this template into your project directory.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn
# or
pnpm install
```

3. Start development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Available scripts

- `dev` — start Vite dev server
- `build` — build for production
- `preview` — locally preview production build
- `lint` — run linter (if configured)
- `format` — run code formatter (if configured)
- `test` — run tests (if configured)

Example:

```bash
npm run dev
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Project structure

A typical layout:

```
/src
  /assets     # images, fonts, static media
  /components # React components
  /pages      # route pages
  main.jsx    # app entry
index.html
vite.config.js
package.json
```

## Environment

- Use `.env.local`, `.env.development`, and `.env.production` to manage environment-specific variables.
- Prefix client-exposed vars with `VITE_` (Vite requirement).

## Deployment

Build and deploy the `dist` directory to any static hosting:

```bash
npm run build
# then upload ./dist to your host
```

## Customization

- Swap styling solutions (CSS, Tailwind, styled-components) as needed.
- Add TypeScript by renaming files to `.ts/.tsx` and installing types + tsconfig.
