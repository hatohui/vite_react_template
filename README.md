# Vite + React Modern Starter

A fast, opinionated template for building single-page applications with Vite, React, and a powerful modern stack.

## Features

- ⚡ Vite for instant dev server and optimized builds
- ⚛️ React 19 for UI development
- 🗂️ File-based routing (see `src/config/dynamicRouter.tsx`)
- 🪝 Zustand for state management
- 🧩 Zod for schema validation
- 🔗 TanStack Query for data fetching and caching
- 🎬 GSAP for advanced animations
- 🌐 i18next for internationalization
- 🛠️ Tailwind CSS for utility-first styling

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies:**

   > **Recommendation:** Choose one package manager (npm, yarn, or pnpm) for your team and stick to it. Mixing package managers can cause lockfile conflicts and unexpected bugs.

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install
   ```

   > Commit only one lockfile (`package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, or `pnpm-lock.yaml`) to your repository.

2. **Start the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   # or
   pnpm dev
   ```

## Scripts

- `dev` — Start Vite dev server
- `build` — Build for production
- `preview` — Preview production build locally
- `lint` — Run ESLint

```bash
npm run build
# then upload ./dist to your host
```
